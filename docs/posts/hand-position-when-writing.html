So I done some research and found out that the best way to have you hand when typing is without resting your palms on you keyboard, basically keep your elbows up like a piano player...because in the long run can cause fatigue and also other wrist problems. After testing this method I am quite happy with the result and I will try to implement it more and more :smiley:.</p></body><footer><p>Copyright Â© 2023-2024 Gabriel Marin</p></footer></head></html>
